              <p>Private detective Feluda and his cousin Topshe are hired by a vexed man to take care of Mukul, his gifted child, who is in Rajasthan with a parapsychologist to find a treasure from his past life. This movie will remain a treasured memory of mine forever. The characters, the dialogues and the scenes directed by Satyajit Ray are exactly the same as that in the original story written by him. With Feluda's extraordinary skills, Jatayu's amusing character, the excitement in the last scene, the interesting story, the movie will never let a person fell unhappy. Everytime we watch the movie, it fills our hearts with joy. </p>

              <p> The story follows Harry Potter's fourth year at Hogwarts as he is chosen by the Goblet of Fire to compete in the Triwizard Tournament. The movie helped me to visualize the scenes perfectly, though I felt scared at times, especially in the last scene. In a nutshell, it described the consequent events of the Triwizard Tournament in a wonderful way.</p>

              <p>The plot follows Simba, a young lion who must embrace his role as the rightful king of his native land following the murder of his father, Mufasa, at the hands of his uncle, Scar. We were taken to watch the movie from our school, and we enjoyed it thoroughly. I was in tears when Mufasa died, and the advice given by Mufasa to Simba near the lake was an inspiring one.</p>

                  <p class="list-group-item-text col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12">The 2019 Amazon rainforest wildfires season saw a year-to-year surge in fires occurring in the Amazon rainforest and Amazon biome within Brazil, Bolivia, Paraguay, and Peru during that year's Amazonian tropical dry season. Fires normally occur around the dry season as slash-and-burn methods are used to clear the forest to make way for agriculture, livestock, logging, and mining, leading to deforestation of the Amazon rainforest. Such activity is generally illegal within these nations, but enforcement of environmental protection can be lax. The increased rates of fire counts in 2019 led to international concern about the fate of the Amazon rainforest, which is the world's largest terrestrial carbon dioxide sink and plays a significant role in mitigating global warming. </p>
